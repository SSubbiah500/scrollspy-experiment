    Though the term 'upside down cake' was not used until the 1870s, these kinds of desserts had been baked since the Middle Ages. However, they were often pies rather than cakes and made with different fruit.  
    In the 1800s, cakes were not baked because not everyone had access to an oven. Instead, they were made in skillets. In the 1870s, the term 'upside-down' cake was born. But canned pineapple still hadn't been invented yet. 
    By 1901, the United States had annexed Hawaii and many American businessman sought to make a profit from it. One businessman from California named James Dole came to Wahiwa on Oahu Island and started mass-growing pineapples. 
    Eventually, he moved his business to Honolulu and an engineer was able to make the process a lot faster by <a href = "https://dolesunshine.com/us/en/history/">creating a machine that could cut up to 100 pineapples per minute. </a>
    By 1907, Dole was placing ads for his pineapple in American magazines and eventually, recipes for pineapple upside-down cake showed up.

    Cheesecake had its origins in Ancient Greece with fresh cheese being pounded with flour and honey until smooth before baked on a griddle. It was considered a great source of energy with atheletes during the First Olympics (776 BC) consuming it daily. 
    By the Middle Ages, cheesecake was created inside a pastry base and eggs were added to it. Many English cookbooks started including this treat and it was eventually brought to the American colonies. 
    The cream cheese now used in cheesecake today was created in 1872 when a dairy farmer from New York named William A. Lawrence attempted to create French Neufchatel cheese. Three years later, a grocery company helped him modify it and it was eventually packed under Philadelphia Cream Cheese.

    The dessert is said to have originated in French chef Charles Ranhofer's restaurant called Delmonico's in New York in 1867. However, the idea of 
    meringue coating ice cream before being heated had also been experimented with by British physicist Benjamin Thompson.

    Though Apple Pie is now an American dessert, the truth is that it originated in Britain and then it was brought over to North America in the 17th century. 
    However, the British Apple Pie did not make a crust because ingredients were expensive. The lattice pie that everyone was familiar with 
    was actually influenced by Dutch immigrants who created these kinds of pies. 
    It was only in the 20th century when Apple Pie became a symbol of America. Throughout the 1920s, it was often associated with comfort and love of home or oftentimes, motherly love. 
    During WWII, many soldiers often said they would fight for "mom and the pie."

    Peach cobbler was originally supposed to be a variation of pie. In the 1800s, American settlers made this by 'cobbling together' 
    bits of dough and canned fruit (settlers often didn't have access to fresh fruit) before baking it over the open fire. 
    Most settlers usually ate the dessert for breakfast as other foods were scarce. It was only in the late 19th century that it was 
    classified as a dessert.
